# vb_gcal

Pulls in a schedule of games for the latest team and creates google calendar events (optionally inviting teammates to the event).

# Setup Environment

You must set up you config files, vendor files, and install dependencies.

To set up the configuration, create a `config` folder with the following files.

- `config.yml`: application-wide config. See `config.yml_sample` for expected values
- `emails.txt`: return-delimited list of emails to add as guest to the events
- `credentials.json`: google calendar credentials. Check out [gcal quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python) for how to get this file
- `token.json`: google calendar auth token. This file is automatically generated and must be deleted if/when scopes change

This utility uses Chrome as the webdriver. As such, you will need to download one and place it in `/vendor`. Current drives can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/). Make sure you download the same major version as your version of Chrome browser.

Dependencies can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It is suggested you create a virtual environment for this utility.

# Running Locally

Once your environment is set up, call `run.py`
